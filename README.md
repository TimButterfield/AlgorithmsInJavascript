# Hacking on Algorithms #

This is a repo for me to hack around with some algorithms. I created primarily to help strengthen my understanding and knowledge of algorithms, but secondarily so that I spent a little more time away from the language that I use most in my day job.

## Why JavaScript?

"Why JavaScript?" I hear you ask!

I decided to pick JavaScript for the following reasons:

* Barrier to entry is low. No IDE's, no complex set up, just atom as my text editor, plain old JavaScript and node for execution. A low barrier to entry means I can focus more on Algorithms and I'm more likely to achieve my goal.

* JavaScript doesn't have the built in richness, data structures and syntactic sugar that comes baked in to other languages. C#, for example, benefits from Generics, Linq, Anonymous functions and Lamdas (to name a few). These are great features, but not having that richness means I can focus purely on solving the problems using algorithms alone. It also means I give consideration to algorithm complexity, The Big O, as well as applying techniques that often occur in algorithm usage/design, such as recursion.

* It's pervasive. * Put a fact here about the growth of javascript (with citing). Therefore it's was a logical choice. There's every possibility that once I get to a happy place with this repo, I might do the same in another language. Possibly Python, possibly a functional language like Elixir.
