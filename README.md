# Hacking on Algorithms #

This is a repo for me to hack around with some algorithms. I created primarily to help strengthen my understanding.  Ultimately because not enough of my day is spent writing or using them, and yet I know how valuable a good understanding of algorithms can be.

Note : This repo is not intended to be a show of production code. it's a repo for me to hack and iterate.

## Why JavaScript?

In case you're wondering, I decided to pick JavaScript for the following reasons:

* Barrier to entry is low. No IDE's, no complex set up, just atom as my text editor, plain old JavaScript and node for execution. A low barrier to entry means I can focus more on algorithms and I'm more likely to achieve my goal.

* JavaScript doesn't have the built in richness, data structures and syntactic sugar that comes baked in to other languages. C#, for example, benefits from Generics, Linq, Anonymous functions and Lamdas (to name a few). These are great features, but not having that richness means I can focus purely on solving the problems using algorithms alone. It also means I give consideration to algorithm complexity, The Big O, as well as applying techniques that often occur in algorithm usage/design, such as recursion.

* It's pervasive. According to the [2018 stackoverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) JavaScript is still the most popular programming language. That doesn't necessarily make it the default choice, but it does mean that there's broad community out there that I have access to for help and feedback.   

* The lions share of my time is spent writing C# code, making infrastructure changes, deploying code, monitoring production applications, pairing, communicating with peers and attending daily/weekly ceremonies. The programing demands of any given project/product varies, but ultimately it makes sense to a step away from the  language that I use the most. The intention being that it can only help me to grow. I've historically disliked JavaScript due to it's idiosyncrasies. Maybe my dislikes are/were valid, but I'm equally willing to challenge my own opinion by spending more time with the language that I've typically used when working on front end code.
